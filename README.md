# Stats199-Debates
Final project report for Stats 199 in Fall 2020, Directed Research in Statistics. I worked under Professor Dave Zes to analyze presidential race polling data to find out if debates actually make a difference in the race. Additionally, I scraped the textual data of all past presidential debates to see if I could observe any historical trends in complexity and sentiment.
